# Nani  
**Aba Hajurko Sirani**: Your grandparents' perfect AI companion, designed to bring joy, safety, and care into their lives.  

Nani was initially envisioned during Hack-a-Week but couldn’t come to life as I lacked the courage to present it. Today, it stands as a project to overcome self-doubt and transform dreams into reality.

## Problem Statement  

In today’s fast-paced world, grandparents often feel neglected and face several challenges:  

1. **Loneliness**  
   - Spending hours alone, with no one to talk to, leads to feelings of disconnection and unimportance.  

2. **Health Management**  
   - Managing medications becomes difficult due to forgetfulness and health issues. Missing doses or mixing medications can have severe consequences.  

3. **Emergency Situations**  
   - Sudden health emergencies require immediate assistance, but when family members are away, help may be out of reach.

## Proposed Solution  

Nani is the bridge that connects elderly individuals to care, companionship, and safety. It addresses the challenges faced by grandparents with the following features:  

1. **Companionship and Engagement**  
   - Facilitates meaningful conversations.  
   - Connects grandparents with others through a virtual platform for sharing stories and building friendships.  
   - Recommends movies, music, and activities to keep them engaged.  

2. **Health Management**  
   - Medication reminders to ensure they never miss a dose.  
   - Monitors health patterns and shares updates (daily, weekly, monthly) with family members.  
   - Alerts family members via SMS and the Nani app in case of health concerns.  

3. **Emergency Response**  
   - Detects distress signals, unusual noises, or emergencies using the smartphone’s microphone and voice recognition.  
   - Sends immediate alerts to family members to ensure prompt assistance.  

4. **Entertainment and Happiness**  
   - Suggests content and activities tailored to their interests.  
   - Keeps loneliness and boredom at bay by engaging them in their favorite pastimes.
